# horiseon
Client submitted code and assets for refactoring.  After review:
HTML was found to lack semantic tags making it difficult to follow and identify elements.  Solution - nondescript 'div's replaced with semantic tags such as 'header,' 'footer,' section,' 'aside,' etc.
HTML was found to have elements out of logical order.  Solution - move elements into logical positions.
Broken link found in nav bar.  Solution - added correct #id insuring the link works as intended.
CSS stylesheet reviewed:
CSS classes contained many redundent elements.  Solution - redundent elements consolidated and renamed (html edited to correctly call new class).  Child elements also renamed and html updated.
CSS sequence found to be out of order.  Solution - edited CSS elements to follow logical progression
Final Result
No change to site visual, layout, or load.  Code refacotred to improve readibility and accessibility.
